Experiment 1 – Introduction to Python Libraries and Dataset Preprocessing

Objective
The aim of this experiment is to explore real-world datasets using Python and to understand basic data preprocessing and visualization techniques.

Libraries Used
Pandas is used for loading and handling datasets.
Matplotlib is used for creating visual representations of data.

Scenarios Covered

Scenario 1: E-Commerce Sales Data
The dataset was loaded and inspected using head(), info(), and describe().
Missing values were identified and product sales were visualized using bar and line charts.

Scenario 2: Hospital Patient Records
Health metrics such as glucose levels and age were analyzed.
Distributions were visualized using histograms and boxplots to observe patterns.

Scenario 3: Housing Dataset
Housing features were inspected and missing values were summarized.
Scatter plots and heatmaps were used to study relationships between price and other features.

Scenario 4: Banking Customer Data
Age was calculated using year of birth and customer demographics were analyzed.
Income and spending patterns were visualized using bar charts and boxplots.

Conclusion
This experiment helped in understanding how to load datasets, detect missing values, and visualize data.
Visualization made it easier to identify trends and relationships in different domains.
